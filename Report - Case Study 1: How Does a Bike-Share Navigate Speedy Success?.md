### Data Analytics Capstone by Google/Coursera

## Introduction: Business Problem <a name="introduction"></a>

The scenario here is that the main stakeholder is Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the objective is to determine how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, I will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Characters and teams
    * Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The mahority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
    * Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and
initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
    * Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about
Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.
    * Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve therecommended marketing program.
